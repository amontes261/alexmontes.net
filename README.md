# Welcome to [alexmontes.net](https://alexmontes.net/)

### Created by Alex Montes (who would've thought)

This project was made using NUXT.js (v2), Vuetify.js (CLI v2), HTML and CSS & is hosted via CloudFlare. It's meant to show information about myself, information about my projects, and show what I'm capable of doing with ReactJS.

## Commands I've Used

### `npm run local`
Starts running the application on your local machine in development mode.\
Your terminal should've provided you with a local URL to visit the working site. To view the site on your own machine, paste the URL that's next to the ***Listening on*** section into your web browser.

### `npm run generate`
Compiles all Vuetify.js and NUXT Files into native HTML & CSS.\
This is the command that CloudFlare runs on the repository code in order to build. The code ends up in a `/dist` directory which cloudflare refers to for rendering the site.
